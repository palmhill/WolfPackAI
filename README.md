A centralized dashboard providing seamless access to all AI services:
- **OpenWebUI** - Interactive chat interface with multi-model support
- **LiteLLM** - Unified API gateway for multiple LLM providers
- **n8n** - Visual workflow automation platform

### 🚀 **Enterprise Architecture**

- **Containerized Microservices**: Docker-based architecture with proper service isolation
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Multi-tenant data persistence across all services
- **Local LLM Support**: Ollama integration with GPU acceleration
- **Development Environment**: Full SSH-accessible development container

### 🔧 **Developer Experience**

- **Multi-Language Development**: Pre-configured .NET, Node.js, Python, and C++ environments  
- **Real-time Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry observability with Aspire Dashboard
- **Hot Configuration**: Dynamic service configuration without restarts

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

WolfPackAI orchestrates the following services in a cohesive microservices architecture:

| Service        | Purpose             | Port | Technology     |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ---- | -------------- |
| **OpenWebUI**  | AI chat interface   | 8080 | Python/Docker  |
| **LiteLLM**    | LLM API gateway     | 4000 | Python/Docker  |
| **n8n**        | Workflow automation | 5678 | Node.js/Docker |
| **Ollama**     | Local LLM runtime   | 1143 | Go/Docker      |
| **PostgreSQL** | Primary database    | 5432 | PostgreSQL     |

### n8n Workflow Automation

## 🔧 Development

### Development Environment Access

The platform includes a full development container accessible via SSH:

```bash
# SSH into development environment  
ssh developer@localhost -p 2222

# Password: devpassword
# Or use key-based authentication
```

**Pre-installed tools:**
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Node.js 22.x
- Python 3.x  
- C++ build tools
- Git, Vim, Nano

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the entire solution
dotnet build

# Run all tests  
dotnet test

# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean
```

For a step-by-step walkthrough of the standalone developer workflow, see [`docs/QUICKSTART.md`](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

### MOD SQUAD Validation

WolfPackAI includes comprehensive MOD SQUAD validation for production readiness:

```bash
# One-command launch with validation
.\bootstrap.ps1

# Or run validation manually
npm run mod:all
```
